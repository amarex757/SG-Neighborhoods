# Singapore Neighborhoods Segmentation
------------------------------------
The JSON file contains a body of points representing all of Singapore's postal codes. The dataset also contains geographical coordinates we can use to generate mappings of the country's popular cities. We will focus primarily on 'Postcode', 'Building', 'Latitude', and 'Longitude'.
# Data is derived from FourSquare API
------------------------------------
Additionally we will integrate the FourSquare API to extend the dataset. The final dataset will include building names, venue categories, venues within a parameter of 500 meters, and geographical coordinates.

* The main dataset can be accessed in the open repository: https://github.com/xkjyeah/singapore-postal-codes.
